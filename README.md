**N**etwork **A**ttack **T**estbed **I**n [Power] **G**rid (**NATI[P]G**), a co-simulation environment for distribution power grid network using state-of-the-art simulators.

It is a standalone, containerized, and reusable environment to enable cyber analysts and researchers to run different cyber security and performance scenarios on powergrid and generate benchmark datasets. It supports IEEE123 and IEEE9500 as the reference powergrid models with communication model using mesh/ring/star topologies. The communication model supports CSMA, WiFi, 4G, and 5G (optional) protocols. 

We demonstrate few attack scenarios in the default framework and provide ways to design additional scenarios using configuration files.

## How to get started
1. Have docker installed
2. clone the NATIG repo ```git clone https://github.com/pnnl/NATIG.git```
3. run the following commands:
   ```
   - cd NATIG
   - bash make_run_docker.sh
   ```
   - If you are using MINGW64 (such as gitbash) on windows, please edit the rundocker.sh: ```the input device is not a TTY.  If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty' ```
     
**NOTE: The default docker container does not come with 5G enabled**

Once the setup is done you can run the out of the box examples
1. go to the control folder inside the integration folder that is located in the home rd2c folder (full path: _/rd2c/integration/control_)
2. make sure that all TP*.txt files are removed by running ` rm -r TP*.txt `
3. run sudo bash run.sh _Full path of work directory (example for docker: /rd2c/)_ _[3G/4G/5G]_ _[9500/123]_

**Note: example command for docker to run 4G example: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 4G "" 9500 ` . Change the 3rd parameter to RC when running of docker in a unix cluster that uses slurm. The 4th parameter is the model number that will be used by gridlabd for the simulation.**

When refering to the 3G example, we are talking about topologies that just use a combination of point to point connections, CSMA connections and wifi connections. There is no 4G or 5G in these examples. 

Finally, when collecting data from recorders in gridlabd, with the IEEE 9500 bus model the files get fully populated at the end of the run. _currently under investigation_

## Out of the box examples

4G or point to point example using a star topology.

For 4G network:

When using the IEEE 9500 bus model, the topology contains 10 substation, 10 middle nodes, 10 user equipments (UE) connected to 10 4G relay antennas (EnB nodes), and one control center.

When using the IEEE 123 bus model, the topology contains 4 substation, 4 middle nodes, 4 user equipments (UE) connected to 4 4G relay antennas (EnB nodes), and one control center.

For base point to point connected star topology:

When using the IEEE 9500 bus model, the topology contains 10 substation, 10 middle nodes, and one control center.

When using the IEEE 123 bus model, the topology contains 4 substation, 4 middle nodes, and one control center.

DDoS enabled and running between 10 and 35 simulated seconds (simulated seconds refers to the time that ns3 tracks and not the wall time). This attack is trying to flood the link between the UE and the Middle node with several junk packets with the goal to slow down and increase packet loss. 

When refering to MIM nodes for DDoS attack scenario: These nodes are simple hops in the network between the substation and the UE nodes for 4G network, or the Control center for the base point to point connected network.

DDoS default parameters in grid.json inside /rd2c/integration/control/config/:
```
NumberOfBots": 4,

Active: 1 ( 1 means that the DDoS is active and 0 means that the DDoS is inactive)

Start: 10,

End: 35,

PacketSize: 1500,

Rate: "40480kb/s",

legitNodeUsedByBots: UE, (This is the node that the bots conducting the DDoS attack connect to)

endPoint: MIM (Refers to the end point of the attack. Usefull if you want to attack multiple links)
```
MIM --> Middle node between the UE and the substation/Control center

Using 4G as the communication protocol:

To run this example in docker: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 4G "" 9500 `

To run this example in docker with the IEEE 123 model: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 4G "" 123 `

To run this example in a unix cluster using slurm: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 4G RC 9500 `

To run this example in a unix cluster using slurm with the IEEE 123 model: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 4G RC 123 `

Using base point to point connected star topology:

To run this example in docker: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 3G "" 9500 `

To run this example in docker with the IEEE 123 model: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 3G "" 123 `

To run this example in a unix cluster using slurm: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 3G RC 9500 `

To run this example in a unix cluster using slurm with the IEEE 123 model: ` sudo bash run.sh /rd2c/ 3G RC 123 `

Interesting outputted data:

1. TP.txt this file contains the performance of each path full path between the control center and the substation. To read this file only take the 20 last inputs per timesteps. if the number of substation changes, only read the last 2 X the number of substations rows per timesteps.

  - column IDs in the file: Timesteps,  path ID , ( sourceAddress / sourcePort --> destinationAddress / destinationPort ) , Throughput of path, lostPackets, Total received bytes since the start of the simulation , Total transmitted bytes since the start of the simulation, loss packet rate, delay per received packets, total transmitted packets since the start of the simulation ,total received packets since the start of the simulation, jitter per received packet

## How to stop the run?

If running using Docker, to stop the run run ` bash killall.sh ` to make sure most threads stop

  - Once script has finished runing run ` ps aux | grep root ` to check that no other thread related to ns3 is still running

  - If some threads have been found run ` kill -9 \<ID number\> ` to kill the remaining thread

## Is the code running?

Once the code has started there are several ways to track the progress:

1. run ` ps aux | grep root ` to see if you can see ns3, helics and gridlabd threads

2. run ` tail -\< Number of lines chosen \> output/ns3-helics-grid-dnp3-\< chosen example ID\>.log ` to see the most recent outputed lines from the run

3. run ` cat TP.txt ` to see the throughput monitoring file being populated

## Getting an updated version of the code

If you want to get an updated version of the NATIG repository run the following instructions (__Currently being tested__):
NOTE: Make sure that there are no un-commited changes in the PUSH/NATIG folder. If you do have some changes just run ` git stash `
NOTE2: before running ` git stash ` make sure that you have a copy of the config files that you changed somewhere else.
```
cd /rd2c/PUSH/NATIG/
./update_workstation.sh
```

## 5G configuration

To enable 5G capabilities:
1. request access to https://gitlab.com/cttc-lena/nr
2. run ``` ./build_ns3.sh 5G /<root folder that the simulation is run on>/ ``` from the NATIG folder in the PUSH folder
  - in the case of Docker run ``` ./build_ns3.sh 5G /rd2c/ ```

## 5G out of the box example

5G example using a star topology.

When using the IEEE 9500 bus model, the topology contains 10 substation, 10 middle nodes, 10 user equipments (UE) connected to 10 5G relay antennas (GnB nodes), and one control center.
When using the IEEE 123 bus model, the topology contains 4 substation, 4 middle nodes, 4 user equipments (UE) connected to 4 5G relay antennas (GnB nodes), and one control center.

DDoS enabled and running between 10 and 35 simulated seconds (simulated seconds refers to the time that ns3 tracks and not the wall time). This attack is trying to flood the link between the UE and the Middle node with several junk packets with the goal to slow down and increase packet loss.

## How to run it on a unix cluster

Step 1: move the RC folder outside of the repository folder. 

Step 2: go to the RC folder and run ./make.sh

Step 3: WIP note make sure that all hard coded links are changed to the location of your code. _Will be fixed soon_ 

Step 4: run the make.sh bash script located in the ns-3-dev folder with the location of the RC folder as an input: ` ./make.sh _location of RC folder_ `

If your system has slurm nodes:

Command to run the simulation: ` sbatch --exclusive run.sh _location of RC folder_ `

If your system does not have slurm nodes:

Command to run the simulation: ` ./run.sh _location of RC folder_ `

## Available configurations
Using the configuration files, a user can create a ring topology that uses wifi as a connection type, for example. Currently with the exception of 5G and 4G a user can mix and match any connection types with any topologies.

Existing error: When using a mesh topology with wifi, we do run into the ressource issue with the docker container. If a user want to run such a topology please limit the number of connections per nodes at 2 to 3 connections per nodes. *currently under investigation*

### Topologies (Only with 3G example)
1. Ring
2. Mesh (partial when using wifi)
3. Star

### Connection types:
1. point to point connections (p2p)
2. CSMA 
3. Wifi (only on 3G example)
5. 4G
6. 5G

### IEEE models (working)
1. 123-node bus model
2. 9500-node bus model (Current it is called using ieee8500.glm, but it is the ieee9500 model)

### Additional tools
To automatically generate the input json files use the get\_config.py from the graph folder. If you want to change the glm file that is used either replace the content of ieee8500.glm with the content of your glm file or replace in the python from the name of the glm file that is passed in by the name of the glm file that you want to use

#### How to generate config json file
1. go to graph folder
2. run ``` python get_config.py <Number of Microgrids> ```
3. the number of Microgrids is the number of Microgrids you want your model to have. Currently only tested even number of Microgrids. 

## Configuration files

1. Location: integration/control/config
2. Available config files:
   - **topology.json**: Used to control the topology of the ns3 network
   - **grid.json**: Used to relate nodes of glm files to ns3 nodes. This file is also used to control the attack parameters.
   - **ns_config.json**: Used as configuration file for Helics

### topology.json
1. Channel parameter: settings for the communication parameter for point to point, csma and wifi networks
2. Gridlayout parameter: settings for 2D layout for wifi networks. This will be enabled in the future for other types of networks. 
3. 5GSetup parameter: settings used in both 5G and 4G networks.
4. Node parameter: settings for each node of the network. The configuration file contains default values for each of the nodes. 

### grid.json
1. Microgrids: connects the gridlabd components from glm with the NS3 nodes. Ex: mg1 is 1 NS3 node.
2. MIM: parameter settings for the man-in-the-middle attacks (injection and parameter changes) 
3. DDoS: parameters for the DDoS attacker (ex: number of bots)
4. Simulation: general parameters for the simulation (ex: the start and end time of the simulation)

### gridlabd\_config.json
1. Helics parameters: Helics broker setup parameters (ex: IP address and port number for helics setup)
2. Endpoint: Gridlabd endpoint

NOTE: to change the helics broker's port, the run.sh, the gridlabd\_config.json and the ns3-*.cc need to be updated. All 3 of the files have a reference to the port used by the helics broker. 

## Simulated attacks

### Currently working
1. Injection attacks (Man-in-the-middle): The attacker trips relays connecting the microgrids to one another and to the grid causing islanding of the microgrid 
2. Parameter changes (Man-in-the-middle): The attacker modifies the Pref and Qref values of two inverters in Microgrid 1 while the microgrids are islanded
3. DDoS: The attacker generates a number of bots that will flood 1 to n nodes in the network to slow down the network performance

### In progress
1. MPI capabilities for the code
2. Examples for Man-In-The-Middle attacks
