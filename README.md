HAGEN repo to build a docker image required for CPS modeling

## Available configurations

NOTE: using the configuration files, a user can create a ring topology that uses wifi as a connection type, for example. Currently with th eexception of 5G and 4G a user can mix and match any connection types with any topologies.

Existing error: When using a mesh topology with wifi, we do run into the ressource issue with the docker container. If a user want to run such a topology please limit the number of connections per nodes at 2 to 3 connections per nodes. **currently under investigation**

### Topologies
1. Ring
2. Mesh
3. Star
4. 5G
#### Future topologies
1. 4G

### Connection types:
1. point to point connections (p2p)
2. CSMA
3. Wifi
