## Performance of out of the box examples

For the following 3 tables the poll request is sent every 15ms. The experiments were ran in docker on a computer running a 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 processor with 16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4 memory.

The following time data was collected for a simulation of 60 simulated seconds and with the debug print statements active
