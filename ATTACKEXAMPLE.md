## Available attacks 

1. Man-In-The-Middle (MIM) Attacks: A Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a malicious actor intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. This breach compromises data integrity and confidentiality, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, inject malicious content, or manipulate communication for fraudulent purposes.
2. Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: A Denial of Service (DoS) attack targets a network or service to make it unavailable to users by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities. This results in service disruption, downtime, and potential financial loss, as legitimate users are unable to access the targeted resource.
